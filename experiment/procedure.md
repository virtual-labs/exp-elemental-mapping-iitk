1. Set the sample for X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy<br> 

2. Obtain the spot pattern for the sample <br>

3. Select the line analysis and appreciate the variation in the composition across the line. You may realize that the composition (or counts) are provided across the length of the line.<br> 

4. Compare the difference between the line analysis and spot analysis of that region from a different location.<br>

5. Obtain the elemental map for the microstructure. <br>

6. As an exercise, you may want to obtain the average composition of each phase, and once you have the relative fraction of each phase, then try to estimate the average composition (by multiplying spot elemental analysis with phase fraction of each phase, and compare that result with the overall composition obtained from elemental mapping or complete area of that microstructure.
